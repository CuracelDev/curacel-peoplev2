**Henry Mascot** *[00:19]*: Welcome. During the. During the week, which stand up do you currently join? 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[00:37]*: The Avengers. 
**Henry Mascot** *[00:38]*: Okay, so you know Fikaya then? 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[00:42]*: Yes, I do. 
**Henry Mascot** *[00:43]*: All right, so should also ideally join this as well. How's it going? How's your. How's your trial task been? How many. You started Wednesday. Okay, so you've done one week. Yes. How's it going? What's wrong with your laptop recently? 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[01:28]*: It's just developed default. The charging is. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:31]*: Yeah. Oh, yeah. If you remove it from power, it goes off. Yes. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[01:40]*: I tried to fix it. They couldn't fix it. So I'm trying to get the new. For some reason. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:50]*: Yeah, so. Yeah, so I mean, when there's no light at home, you can't work. That's sad. Yeah, that makes sense. But. Okay, cool. What are you working on again? What's your trial project? 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[02:04]*: Okay, so I'm going to do the weekly updates. Summarizes. Collect and summarizes data across the Internet. 
**Henry Mascot** *[02:20]*: From individual. So far. Where are you? How far have you gone? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[02:29]*: I've collected. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[02:31]*: I have the. So I want get slack on this pocket. But I've already like established a framework. I've set up environment. I already set up. 
**Henry Mascot** *[02:48]*: So once I receive. Once I. Okay. Christoph. I mean, again, if you have any issues, feel free to. To escalate. Where is. Hope you're able to focus on work in the office. It feels like it's quite loud. Are you able to work from there? Yeah, I've been able to. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[04:03]*: I've been able to make sure. It's just not that it gets me. 
**Henry Mascot** *[04:32]*: All right, which meeting were you in? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[04:47]*: Hi, good afternoon. I was in the AIC. The one starting by 3 o'. 
**Henry Mascot** *[04:53]*: Clock. Okay. Alpha now. How's it going? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[04:59]*: Yeah, I'm good. 
**Henry Mascot** *[05:10]*: You can mute yourself. D. So if you're going to go down the route of like he's escalating, like the gruesomeness. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[05:45]*: So you can see my screen now? 
**Henry Mascot** *[05:47]*: Yes, we can. There. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[05:49]*: So, yeah, based upon our last conversation about, you know, just having like a data pipeline basically from the interest form that take all the informations basically. And also where like we have like a customizable template for like this job position where we have the ideal candidates, the scorecard, the rubrics, the Rubik's scorecard, the rules and you know, the rules that will be bring basically and. 
**Henry Mascot** *[06:28]*: Yeah. Okay, let me just share my screen. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[06:32]*: I don't know. Can you see my screen? 
**Henry Mascot** *[06:35]*: Okay. And my. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[06:38]*: Let me just reload the page. 
**Henry Mascot** *[06:46]*: Yeah, well done. I like this. But make it open in the Full page. I don't think we need any models. No need for models. Unless it's, like, small things. So there's so much information here. This should be like a full page. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[06:58]*: Okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[06:59]*: Yeah. All right, cool. Yeah, because it's a lot of information, right? The space you're cramming in and, like, can fit in. Right? So, yes, so let it be like a full thing. And then the menu can be collapsible as well so that, like, the information can just like, spread out on the page. Okay, so is this. This is again. Okay, cool. When the candidate on boards, kind of like the fresh crunch of the candidate profile sits on here, right? Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[07:31]*: No, like, we have the applicant section here. So basically. Right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[07:43]*: Resume. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[07:43]*: You can find it here. 
**Henry Mascot** *[07:45]*: And if I can, I want this to be full. Right. So the applicant thing, I don't know. Make it. Make it a table. You know, you click into the table, it opens a full thing. Because there's a lot of information that you want to. You want to digest. Even though I like that you can flick up three people real quick. So unless there's an easy way to collapse, when you open someone, it collapse. Because other than that, then it's a bit. It's a bit like pact. I mean. I mean, like, the main side menu is here. The names are here. And then there's also a lot of information you're trying to consume. There you are. So. So maybe there's also a way that one, this one with the applicant names can also. When you open it can collapse and then, you know, or whatever. 
**Henry Mascot** *[08:30]*: Right, But I mean, this is good. If the menu collapses, then it moves all the way to the. To the left. And then the thing, this other one, fuse the screen. This is. This is cool. Okay, so this is the candidate's profile. So immediately the candidate indicates interest, and then their data comes in. Then you start to crunch the data. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[08:49]*: Yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[08:50]*: Yes. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[08:51]*: Yeah, so we start crunch data here. Like, this evaluation was basically based off on the interview stuff that, like, I was testing it earlier, but yeah, this is the profile. Like, it's sticks in like the OC interview. 
**Henry Mascot** *[09:10]*: Yeah. Experience, like meaningful work experiences. Let's make the score. Let's go make it like 100%. Let's make it 1 to 100 so we can capture a bit more nuance. Is the score real or is it like. What Is it real? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[09:33]*: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Like this one over, like 0.5, over 5%. It's just basically LLM just trying to everything. 
**Henry Mascot** *[09:45]*: Yeah, please. You remember, right? Let me pull out what's my. What's the name of that thing I shared? What is it? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[09:57]*: The Google. The Google Slides. 
**Henry Mascot** *[09:59]*: Slides, yeah. Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[10:01]*: Recruitment, Recruiter agents. 
**Henry Mascot** *[10:05]*: So on the recruiter agent. Yeah. So this is the flow. I work through the flow, but then this is where I give the profile. Prehire interest interview, QSL stage. Okay, cool. So there's something I like now YC does. Right? Let me see. I can show you real quick. So I like this thing YC does. I. I don't know how they do it, but I like that they do it. And we're probably gonna like try to borrow it in here as well. So obviously all our applications come through like yc. And so for instance, this executive operations role that we're hiring, you can see that like this person is a pet. So what it does is like crunches the person's TV and like their LinkedIn, I think, and their cover letter, I think. And then it tries to like assign them like numbers. 
**Henry Mascot** *[11:06]*: So if I, if you keep scrolling since it's 56, there may be people that will be like 93. Right. For instance, like this person is in 93. So that means I look at this as a CV, has looked at like the COVID letter. I looked at a bunch of things and it's like, boom. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[11:18]*: This person is like automatically grids them. 
**Henry Mascot** *[11:21]*: It automatically greets them. Right? It greets them. And so our grading would also be a kind of like a grading would be. Like I said to you, a grading would be stage by stage. There's a grading of just like when you apply and then that's held into that stage. And then there's the grading of every single stage. And then there's like an overall grading that takes all the grading and puts it together so you don't have to rag all the data at once. You can see, okay, this is a 90 something here at the stage. Attend in this stage, at this. In this stage. And then when you put it together, the overall score becomes something. Right? Because maybe you don't do very well in this interview. Sure would rate you for the interview. You don't do well, but like averagely, right? 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:01]*: So you might have people that like do very well in one thing, but then like cumulatively don't do very well. Yeah. Yeah, Cool. So, yeah, so this is. I mean, this is a very good start. They click on the person, right. I'm kind of like thinking if there is any need to have them side by side, I mean, the reason you probably want to have Them. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[12:32]*: Was it the ideal versus actual country? 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:35]*: No, no. I'm still kind of like thinking about the ux. I think maybe we should bring. We should kind of like spend some time with design to kind of like think through this a little bit. So for instance, I. The part you're doing now feels very similar to this, which is you can click through and then see them. So maybe. But then this is assuming that you're filtering to. Through people, but this is actually not how we use it. So this is not even very. I think this makes sense if you're kind of like chatting with them and you want to also engage them. So I would say that your current view of like making this look like this makes sense if you kind of want to clicking and Charlie them. But when you're just looking at the candidates. 
**Henry Mascot** *[13:25]*: Yeah, I just want to see like through. Right. Because I'm not. I just want to see everything through. So. Yeah. So maybe copying something that looks like this makes sense. Where. Okay, cool. The total list looks like this. And then you put the camera profile their details. I mean, if there's any picture we can pull from LinkedIn, sure, happy to do that. If not, leave that. And what do they apply for if we're looking at it generally or if there's any detail. I don't know where he pulls this from. I think I can also give you access to this if you want to go in here and see if you can learn it. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[13:59]*: Yeah, definitely. 
**Henry Mascot** *[14:02]*: So let me just, let me add you as the user. What's your email again? Right, so it's gonna invite you to kind of like the thing and then you can take a look. I mean, it's not a ton. I mean, since you're trying to build, you know, I'm a lot more, I'm a lot more interested in just sort of like the interview flow rather than like the whole kind of like job flow. But yeah, they also have like a proper like job flow where you can like do the. Do the. Kind of jd, do the whatever. But I, I don't think you should focus too much on that for now. I mean, you don't have a ton of time anymore, so let's focus on the jd. So when you click on the. This opens up the person's profile. 
**Henry Mascot** *[15:07]*: Any, any conversation they had is in there. But I don't think it doesn't tell us how it's reading. You can add them to favorites, you can report them, you can archive them, you can share, but it doesn't really say. It's just this just shows the thing obviously for us when you click in them like it opens out your proper profile. Right. And then we can see those stages that we're dealing with. But high level. Yeah. If we want to kind of like ingest people and then we can see their scores is a 10. So I mean people don't even bother. We don't even bother. Let me look at this person's profile. But we don't even bother like looking at someone who scores low because we know that like there's no need. So why she has already done that work. 
**Henry Mascot** *[15:45]*: Management training, loan and sales say I can see recently see this person is not like switched on. Right. Compared to what we're having then when you look at like and so the reason I actually like this thing is this thing has actually. I mean it misses it some in some places but like it's actually pretty good. Right. The top performing people in kind of like this role that we're hiring are still like people who score like this guy is really good. This lady is really good. I mean happy distress and I don't think we interviewed this person. I wonder why we didn't discuss again procurement and finance. Yeah, that's why we didn't chat with her. Yeah she's. She's off. When do we give. I wonder why this is also one of the reasons. 
**Henry Mascot** *[16:30]*: So, so yeah so if the LLM rates people right for the model you're working on you should probably like when you click into their profile you should probably have like a something that explains why it gives them that when you. Why you rated them as that you currently have that. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[16:46]*: No, not at the moment. 
**Henry Mascot** *[16:47]*: Oh it does. I did not. I have not seen this before. It does look at it. Operational directing implementing AI. His background is health tech aligns exceptionally literacy. So yeah it does. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. Let me go and look at it up. So it does. So it gives like a small summary. So let's look at this lady for instance that I highly experienced a patient. So yeah it's because of recruitment is also operation. That's why even though it's to play a direct experience partner with cushionary experience DOHA LLM would need to be further explored a direct experience partnering with seniors. Where did she say she's partnered with? Because I think one of the things he also does is crunches her. Is this her cover? Okay. It's not here. There's no partner received to you here. 
**Henry Mascot** *[17:50]*: Let's see if it's high. Is there any CEO partner directly. We see you. So it's crunching the PDF. Can you see my screen? I'm not so sure. Yes, I am. Yeah, so, yeah, so it's crunching all the text in our. In our stuff. So yeah. So this partner we see you is what to say. I don't think it's in her. I don't think it's. Is it in her? See here? Yeah, it's not on there. Yeah, I don't like. I don't look at jds. I don't look at G. I don't look at Sorry and cvs. But yeah, I can see that it's the AI is crunching the sea. Because the reason I don't really look at CV is because people kill up their CV for the role. Yeah, but it doesn't really. As you can see here, just procurement and finance. 
**Henry Mascot** *[18:46]*: But then in the CV she broke it down. Global procurement, Robo procurement. Okay, I can see why. I can see why you put that in. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[19:03]*: Interesting. 
**Henry Mascot** *[19:04]*: Okay but. But anyways, that's. That's pretty much it for me. Any. Any other. Let me. Let's keep going. So yeah, so you choose the person's profile. So what's in the overview? Yes sir. So this is complete profile. Let's go to over here. Okay. So it pulls out. Where is he putting this out from? From the LinkedIn or the CV. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[19:37]*: Okay, so this complete overview is when we want to add like an applicant. Since I have not. I. I think this would upgrade in the sense of when we have like an interest form or something. So like the API just add directly right now just kind of manual. 
**Henry Mascot** *[19:58]*: So like I said. Right. The input needs to be. I think I gave you like a flow for where the input will come from. Did I not do something like this? Remember, you need to go to. Do you have any document from our last meeting? Because I broke this. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[20:13]*: I listened to like the. I listen to. 
**Henry Mascot** *[20:17]*: Yeah, but you need a document because the document will kind of like give you a roadmap because you listen to it. But like document would help give you. I mean the reason I wanted you to have that document, the reason I did a lot of dumb. So that like you can have that document and then you can put in charge and then you can use it to kind of like say okay, cool, how do we do this? Like what's a good flow? And use it to brainstorm. So I think the impute should be. The input should be two things. I think that since we're using YC to apply. Most likely the best way that data will go in would be from YC. I don't think they have any APIs today. They have integrations so they don't have API so we can't connect. 
**Henry Mascot** *[21:08]*: So what we might be able to do might be that we might build and again this is outside your own scope. I'll figure it out. So right now the only thing they allow is these ats, but we're building our own ats which is what you're really working on. So but they only have these and I think they did like an internal integration to this Are probably. We probably ask them if There are any APIs that can allow us to access any webhooks that allow us to access our data here since we don't use these and we have an internal one. In the absence of that, I think you should do the input to be able to allow when you're adding the applicant. So let there be an API impute. Just enable that in there somewhere that there could be a web loop or whatever. 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:06]*: Simplest way for you to push data into something. It doesn't have to be super secure. It can be easy since we're the only ones that have access. Can be like a get thing like a simple API thing that pushes data in and I accept like documents and you know, whatever and then process what. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[22:23]*: Are we getting from like what are we doing? 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:27]*: So that's what I'm saying because if we have that, what we can do is we computer we can build a custom any 10 or very custom product that goes into Y scripts the data and then sends that data to this. So it's either we have it on webhook or at this applicant can accept a PDF upload and a LinkedIn thing. Oh yeah. Do you currently accept that now when. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[22:52]*: You click add what is it like Accept PDF. 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:56]*: Let me click. Let me see. Okay. Accept cdf. So yes, let it accept as well. Like What? Yeah, so LinkedIn so we can script to the LinkedIn so we add LinkedIn and script it. Okay, so LinkedIn so you can script it. I don't think we need. Yeah, email. Okay. Email is good. So yeah, so this view is good. Just extend it for like take LinkedIn and then take the PDF. Is there anything else we ask for? I think that's pretty much it and enable us to do this via code. Right Somehow. So what I will try to figure out is okay, can I be the simple anytime workflow that use the data from YC and sends it to you. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[24:22]*: When you're writing. What is the best way to get from yc either to have like a web or. 
**Henry Mascot** *[24:34]*: Yeah, mean, YCVC doesn't have anything. So we have to build a manual scraper. I was already working on this with. But I was working on it to scrape. I was going to use like a Chrome thing to script the. Script it and then put it on a. On a sheet. On a sheet that we use. I mean, I showed you that sheet, right? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[24:52]*: No, no, you didn't. 
**Henry Mascot** *[24:53]*: I think maybe I'll add you one sheet as well. And just so that you can also. So let's see, I'm gonna add you one sheet that I. The exact ops sheet so that you can also speak what our process looks like. So this is the exact option, right? So again, I'm not sure to what extent a lot of things we're doing. And so baloney is also setting up. I think we've now built, as of sometime this week. We have now built. We have now built. I think I share my window so I can share. So yeah, so that's why I'm trying. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[25:52]*: To focus a little bit of what. 
**Henry Mascot** *[25:54]*: You'Re doing because there's a lot of activity happening in a lot of places. For instance, we're now using any terms to automate the whole thing. So for instance, this, right? So again, so this is like a flow. You know, you apply. There are a bunch of stages in here. We'll move you across the stages. That's okay, you know what you're you. When you fill a Google form, when you feel the Google form, where's that Google? So when you apply for yc, here's the process. When you apply to yc, someone goes into that YC thing, puts that data, puts it in here. So link your Link, put your LinkedIn, connect to your email and then you know, that's it, right? That's the first thing that happens, right? This is the only thing we get from voice when someone goes in and chats with you, right? 
**Henry Mascot** *[26:53]*: So I have the first interview, depending on who has the first interview, after the first interview, I think we send you a form. After the first interview, we send you a form, this Google form, right? We sent you this Google form, right? So I mean if any first interview you get this Google form, you feel the Google form, you put in a bunch of details, blah, blah. After you fill the Google form, someone has to go get that, those details from this form. I, for instance, this person is an entj and put it on Here, from this formula, salary is also there, we put it in there, then we send you two assessments. Right. We send you a testify, blah, blah. That's to go to the website if you have any APIs. Let's see, any APIs. Okay, they have webhooks manages feature with integration. 
**Henry Mascot** *[28:00]*: Should you have to pay for it. But. Okay, cool. They have webhooks. But why do we already paying for you now you need to pay more understanding. Yeah, but these guys have API. It's just that they're. They have it, they're trying to. So we need to figure this out. But these guys have APIs. But anyways, so there's a test. You take a test from here, test reads you. So again, someone has to go to the platform, download the test, link it in here. This one is another platform test gorilla. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[28:35]*: We have. 
**Henry Mascot** *[28:48]*: Any APIs. So yeah, so that's what I'm saying. Right. So it might be hard to. For you to be able to fully automate. So we just need to kind of figure out what is the easy way. So maybe for some of these things we might not integrate, but might download the report and upload. That might be just it. I don't think this one's have APIs. There's nothing here that looks like team management. Nothing here that looks like. Yeah, this one doesn't have any APIs. There's no obvious step. Oh, it's the beautiful thing about having AI do customer support. You don't have to wait for human beings to be a. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[29:59]*: Plus. 
**Henry Mascot** *[29:59]*: Plan. You can retrieve this. Yeah, I think we are on the. Which plan are we? We're on the free plan for this. Yeah. So we might not get API access. So that's fine. So that means whenever someone takes a test, you can just go download it. So let's assume for the. That you just go and then download the result and then upload into like the agent you're building. I guess that's the only way. I mean later, I mean it might be possible to build a computer use model that can automate this. But for now that makes sense. So. Yeah. So you're still following Abby? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[30:53]*: Yes, I am. Yes, I am. 
**Henry Mascot** *[30:54]*: All right, someone puts this on YC after chatting with you, they send me the form. After you finish your interview, they'll put your details on the sheets and then you get the next test. After doing the next test, you know, that gets updated on this sheet and then you schedule your interview. Right. So this is interview. Then you do your panel interview. And after your Panel, interview and then all those things as they're happening. All your details are also being updated here. So your LinkedIn, your all your fireflies of all your recordings, which again you already have. And then this charge GPT analysis is sort of like what we're trying to have you do so that we can stop like adding. So it can now be automatic. 
**Henry Mascot** *[31:36]*: So essentially we're looking for a simple way of really taking this whole process that we have on spreadsheets and different apps and then centralizing it really on one product. Right. So, and so like our, I think when you apply into the YC thing, your data gets pulled into the back thing. Okay, cool. Whatever the next stage is, you know, all the data is obviously getting reflected. So I mean if you finish taking the test, you know the test. This, this two data comes from a Google form. Maybe there's a Google form you connect to Google from as well. Put the data update that Dashboard Testify and Big Ocean. Since we don't have, we're not paying for the plan. 
**Henry Mascot** *[32:16]*: If we're paying for the plants, we can do API pool, but since we're not paying for the plant, someone just needs to go in, download this and upload it. It computes it as well and puts it on there. I think that's pretty much. I don't think we need this anymore because like this is just a way of aggregating information. You can just see, okay, all the fireflies go there. So yeah, so that's one just showing the information. I think one thing that we're doing now that is cool is that the whole process is now getting automated. So immediately she updates a sheet. And again this is super new. So this still immediately updates the sheets, you know, with. Okay, cool. You pass the next stage, it automatically sends you the email you need for the next stage. 
**Henry Mascot** *[33:03]*: Maybe you pass the next stage, the updates. So this one is where we automate the emails for every single stage. Instead of copying every single time and sending email, blah blah. So I think she does it on a separate sheet, but I assume the sheet, she does it maybe she maybe moves you to next stage. Boom. You get an email that says boom, you have got into the next stage, blah blah. Click here to book a meeting or click here to pick a test. Right. So, but, but that's fine. You don't have to worry about the email one for now. So right now what we can kind of like start to figure out is. Okay, cool. How do you again do those flows to map how our journey Currently looks okay. Quick. If we can't scrape from yc, that means let's update them. 
**Henry Mascot** *[33:50]*: Upload the information. You already have that. So when you upload the information it should extract the right things. Let's go back to your stuff. Let's see what you're currently extracting. So extracting the years of experience, professional background, right? Yeah. So this definitely. I like this span out. So yeah, so D2 applied screening stage, professional background, some sort of high level. So yeah, so it would be a combination of. So so instead of having all these. I guess the most important information would be things like. So if you apply your CV is there. So it has, it's the YC thing first. That puts. Gives you a score right. For your application and then it gives the summary of why it's giving you that score. Right. And then email and then your LinkedIn. So the link to your LinkedIn is missing now. 
**Henry Mascot** *[34:41]*: So add the link to your LinkedIn, your email. That's cool. I think for now those ones are the things we care about. I mean and then you can have like a small summary of their profile which is what we have there. I think that's pretty much it. That's pretty much it for this stage. What do you want to be on the CV side? Like click on there. What are you doing with that again? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[35:14]*: Yes sir. 
**Henry Mascot** *[35:15]*: What is it? What are you doing on the CV side? What's on the CV thing? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[35:20]*: Okay, okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[35:26]*: Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[35:26]*: This is just like for the manual upload but I think you just. 
**Henry Mascot** *[35:31]*: Yes. Yeah. So you don't need a. You don't need that anymore. We can summarize all the summary. So this CV side goes away. So yeah. Questions again. This whole flow. I've already given you this flow on that slide which is what is in every single tab. Rehire. I'm already giving you kind of like a Prehire interest indication. Sorry, Prehi. No interest is this first page you're showing me which is kind of like the overview. And then the next stage is pretty much, I guess you know, the first interview stage. Right. I will give you access to this sheet as well and feel free to kind of like pull pills or. I think, I think you should actually not be chatting with me once. I think you should maybe chatting a couple of times or even chatting. You telling me them. 
**Henry Mascot** *[36:24]*: So I'm going to give you access to the sheet as well that has the existing flow so you can see the process and you might. It might also be okay to just start with one rule. So just say, let's assume this executive ops. Will you start with this rule, Replicate the rule. Because I mean, the process would change for rules. Like the way engineering, the engineering hiring works is also different. Engineering, you take a can test first and you do a coding test, then you do an interview, then you do a trial. So it's also different. We can't replicate everything at once. So let's just start with one flow and then, you know, when we've done one flow, we can maybe send up flow as a profile or like a schema and then do another one. 
**Henry Mascot** *[37:12]*: And so maybe when you're creating a rule, you can select what flow type it is and it. That means what flow uses. Does that make sense? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[37:22]*: Yes, it does. Right, cool. 
**Henry Mascot** *[37:27]*: So this is where you generate questions. So you select the. Then you select the question situation of behavior and then you click generate and it generates the questions. This is cool because right now what we do is we go to ChatGPT and then we will put the thing and then we generate another thing as well. That I can show you, since you're already here, is what we call a rubric. So for every single role we do a rubric, which is what you're showing me, which is where we generate. But I know, see, we go to trajectory to generate it. But yeah, with this internally, automatically. So you can see for this. Right, so this is still the executive approval. This is what they do. Someone goes, tragic. 
**Henry Mascot** *[38:12]*: It generates all the questions according to setting categories, you know, which is still like a little bit of what you are currently showing. Raw motivational curiosity. I don't know, like I need to chat with them to kind of like figure out how they determine which categories to select so that you can add it to your drop down. But yeah, they generate the questions person. And I also think one of the things they also do. So they, the general questions they generate. And then what they also do is when they upload a CV and the LinkedIn and all the information of the person, it pillows it as well for the person. So this is a general question. But then for Alice, it's still the same general questions, but it changes a few things. 
**Henry Mascot** *[38:52]*: You've already built delivery frameworks because again, he saw it on our profile, he sees it on kind of like our stuff with Kabiru. The same questions look a bit different. Where is it? Yeah, so same question, right? So you can see it's a bit different. The first thing is what attracted you to this? You know, what drew you to this. The second question is follow up, you already did delivery. How would you translate? So you can see the questions also get evolved a little bit depending on, like, your previous stuff. Right. So, yeah, so our flow is. Yeah, there's the general questions, but then for each person, it also allows for, like, customized, like, you know, every single person stuff gets generated a bit different. So that's it. That's like for every single stage. So this is for stage one. 
**Henry Mascot** *[39:43]*: So down here is the stage one. Then the next stage is a panel interview. So for the panel interview, then the panelists, I think there are some questions that are automatically generated, but then the panelists also generate their own questions. So for instance, Java, we say, okay, cool, I wanna. Based on our profile and shared, I want to ask her this question and I want to ask her this. Jt. She's like, I'm going to ask her this and going to ask her this. So, yeah, so there's a. There's kind of like this impute that allows like analysts to also impute their own questions. Right. So I guess how we would look in our own would be that. How we would look in our own is. Okay, cool. Here for the. The general questions that you generate. 
**Henry Mascot** *[40:27]*: And then maybe it's there, but then, you know, you also listen to their profiles, try to figure out what do we generate more. You can chat with them to figure out what prompts they're using. You can embed those as, like, system prompts for whatever you're doing here, because they have prompts they already use for those things. So I guess after the first interview, which is. So let's say this one is for interview version one, but then version two, which is maybe a panel, there are maybe some templated questions also generated. But then it also allows the panelists to impute their own question. So the question is, now how would that flow look? Is there like a view that they generated or do someone just, like, ask them to generate it and give them. And copy and paste it in here? So, yeah, so. 
**Henry Mascot** *[41:15]*: So that definitely, like, needs to be figured out Again, we don't need to do all that. It could be full. We keep it a simple question generator. Instead of them going to charge, we just do it here. And then after the interview, they upload the transcript and then the thing computes. Right. So we just figure out where. What level of complexity you want to deal with, and then we leave the rest. Yeah. Can you still hear me? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[41:52]*: Oh, yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[41:54]*: All right, Interview. Let's go to interviews. Okay. Yeah, I mean, schedule interview this is the one you're doing for recording. I don't. Yeah, we don't need to. As long as the voice thing. There's plenty. I think for now we can keep it simple, which is maybe we just. We'll just upload the transcripts of the. Of the meeting, right? We download it from Fireflies. Or you just integrate Fireflies, right? Where if you integrate Fireflies in the sense that, I mean, the cool thing to do would be eventually for it to like automatically pull it, go to Fireflies, do some sort of search on like meetings, and then look for name, right, that match, and then ask you whatever. But like, I think that's a bit long. What we can do is just keep it simple. You can attach a Fireflies meeting, right? There's a search. 
**Henry Mascot** *[42:50]*: You can say attach meeting instead of scheduling meeting. Attach meeting, right? You search. It pulls out all the meetings, recent meetings. You're dealing with the Firefly search API. You pull out the meetings, you select which one. That's it. I can push that one in, meeting attached. And then what you can do is you can pull the. You can put a summary, you can put a transcript, and then you can even put a video link and those are really pretty much the only things you need. And then to crunch, the only data we need to put into the decision engine is just a transcript, right? So here's what the question. Here's everything that happened and he crunches it to figure out. Okay, cool. And like I also say, every single stage should have the score, right? 
**Henry Mascot** *[43:36]*: So when you upload your CV, there's the 90 score. When you do interview version one, stage one, we call it stage one, introduced stage one, which is HR screening, there's a score you have based on the meeting recording and what the AI is judging you based on the competency framework. It is. Etc. So actually that one was the first thing I showed you. Have you done any work towards that direction? What did you say? Have you done any work towards this? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[44:10]*: And that's what. 
**Henry Mascot** *[44:12]*: Okay, so you remember, right, that the first thing. So where we are right now is here, right? The first thing is here. When you set up the job, you remember there's a bunch of data you need to put in. When you set up the job, you put in the competency. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[44:32]*: So. 
**Henry Mascot** *[44:32]*: No, hold on. First of all, I said that there was a, there's a, there's a. Yeah, so there's a. There's an overarching criteria which is set up. So these never change. So this model never Changes the competencies. The values and the competencies are the same. The personality typing types for the existing team is there and all that. So this never changes. So you. So having seen the new setup, something in the settings view that allows us to set this up. Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[45:12]*: So like when. 
**Henry Mascot** *[45:17]*: You want to apply for. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[45:20]*: Values and competence now. 
**Henry Mascot** *[45:25]*: Yeah, but where do you set it up? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[45:27]*: It's in the job position. 
**Henry Mascot** *[45:29]*: No, no. So you're still talking about something else again. This is why I asked you to use it to lay out your roadmap. Right? So that this is different. Right? There are two things here. The one you're talking about is you're already talking about the current role. The values and the competencies don't change. Right? Our cursor values don't change. They're always the same. The personality types don't change. The existing team profiles on Chain, these things are like. Kind of. Kind of like. Call it like, whatever. Like our internal cop, which is like our. Our rulebook is our Lori. It never changes. The rule changes. So the one you're showing me is, for this, you upload the. You upload the jd, you upload the rubric or scorecards, the competency thing, everything. That's it. This is what you just showed. But this one is general. 
**Henry Mascot** *[46:18]*: It applies to every single one. Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[46:27]*: I'm following you. 
**Henry Mascot** *[46:44]*: Here? Running on lead to another thing. Sorry, my network was a bit bad. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[49:02]*: I can hear you. The guy said he wants to quickly grab something. 
**Henry Mascot** *[49:07]*: All right, yeah, that's fine. Just tell him I'm out. Tell him I'm out. Yeah, okay. Sa it. Sa. Okay, I'm not sure. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[51:17]*: I didn't quite get it before. 
**Henry Mascot** *[51:19]*: You left before. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[51:25]*: Okay, now catch up with him. 
**Henry Mascot** *[51:32]*: Yeah. 
**Demilade Kolawole-Jacobs** *[51:34]*: All right, I'll see you later.
