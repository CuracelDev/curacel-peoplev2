**Henry Mascot** *[00:01]*: Man like Ricardo. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[00:03]*: Hi. 
**Henry Mascot** *[00:07]*: Good afternoon. How you doing now? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[00:11]*: I'm very well, thank you. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[00:12]*: How about you? 
**Henry Mascot** *[00:15]*: I mean it's gonna be a good day. No, really, I've been at it. But yeah, but I'm not, I haven't gotten into my actual work. It's just, I'm just in manager mode, just looking at things. My work start maybe in another two hours. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[00:38]*: Yeah, actually inspiring. You're inspiring you though, because you say you work 18 hours. That's actually. 
**Henry Mascot** *[00:50]*: What to do now. You have to, we're trying to be one of the best now. You have to put the, put in the time. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[00:57]*: Right, yeah, yeah, I understand that. Like, I think that's also something that I've always been thinking about. Yes, you want to be one of the best, just put in the effort. But also health factor matters, right? So I'm always thinking about like my. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:11]*: Else is not true. There's no such thing as health. What do you mean? Like when you're in school they have to read like all nights and so on and so forth. Right. So you see. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[01:21]*: Yeah, because I knew that like I does what I needed to do at the time, but I knew that was not going to be forever. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:27]*: Right. So. So I mean one of the people always get. When you're people always have all these, oh, you know, it's not safe. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[01:39]*: Boss, Sorry, I can't hear you. I don't know. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:41]*: Oh, okay, one second. Please, can you join our caller? There's a call on your calendar. Did you miss it? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[01:50]*: Hello? Let me, let me disconnect and connect back again. 
**Henry Mascot** *[02:01]*: So, yeah, so I mean like, you know, people always have the, oh, you know, as far as you sleep. You know, most people can survive like six hours of sleep. Right. Even though. Yeah, it's recommended as an adult. Sleep eight hours. You sleep eight hours. If you take 24 out of eight, what's remaining? That's what's remaining. What's meaning. Ayo, how's it going? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[02:33]*: I see it's going with us. How's it going, sir? 
**Henry Mascot** *[02:37]*: Yeah, good, good. That's 16 hours. But I mean you don't have to work for 18 hours, right? I mean like. Yeah, you know, it's like, you know, 12 works, you know, 14 works. You know, I guess how people are able to stretch it is, you know, if they, you know, you put in the work in the weekends. But yeah, but there's no. You have to work smart. I mean the argument in the past used to be, oh, I don't want to work hard, I want to work smart. But then what's happening to the person who's as smart as you, who's working twice as hard as you? Right, so, yeah, so. But it's also not just about the hard work. It's also a function of what are you working on. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[03:19]*: Right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[03:19]*: You know, what are you working on and who are you working with? Right. It depends. Those things are important. Right. So obviously if you're working with people who are also smart, very hardworking to see, then it keeps leveling up. You know, I always talk about San Francisco. I mean, that's the difference. Those guys are. They're very smart. But then they're also working extremely hard. So I don't think there's anybody that's working harder than like people in like, you know, San Francisco and Beijing. That's like the two China. Anyways, how's your thing going? I see that you made some progress. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[04:00]*: Yes, sir, I made some progress and I've been trying to even refine it better to also cater for the API validation that we spoke about in the last call. So it's still kind of hallucinating, but I think in terms of the output, everything looks good. I've tested it. Okay, let me switch to another branch. All right, Boss, can you see my screen? Okay, so I've been working on a different branch, so I'm just going to switch to a working branch, so I can tell. 
**Henry Mascot** *[04:55]*: But I thought he was already adding tickets to adding comments to the jira. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[05:01]*: Yes, it does that. So I, I just created a workflow. Let me just switch check. Just a minute, boss, I'm trying to switch back to the working branch. 
**Henry Mascot** *[06:16]*: No problem at all. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[06:47]*: Okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[07:17]*: Okay. I mean, if you still need to get it working a little bit, that's fine. We can let give his update and then you can go. Yeah, yeah. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[07:27]*: It's actually not going to take too much time. I'm only just trying to call. I need to pull the branch that was working that I deployed to. 
**Henry Mascot** *[07:40]*: Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[07:41]*: Yeah, just a minute. 
**Henry Mascot** *[07:44]*: Okay. Okay, so now you be this Emmanuel. I feel like I've seen. Okay, I probably saw your picture in or hands because his face looks familiar. Slack, this is. It's just, I don't think it's like you don't have your image on Slack. No. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[08:13]*: Or maybe LinkedIn. 
**Henry Mascot** *[08:16]*: I mean, have you spoken on LinkedIn? Because I've seen your picture somewhere before. I think it's probably Slack. Sorry. I think it's probably Google Meets. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[08:25]*: Oh, yeah, sure. 
**Henry Mascot** *[08:26]*: Maybe Monday or Hands. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[08:33]*: Okay, so I just merged, so I should get this working out. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[08:40]*: Okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[08:49]*: Oh, are you in Kigali? Huh? Are you in Kigali? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[08:56]*: No, not. Not right now. 
**Henry Mascot** *[08:58]*: Okay. Because you have kigali on your LinkedIn. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[09:00]*: Yeah, I was. I was there a couple of days ago. Okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[09:06]*: Cool. You were a Branch. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[09:09]*: Yes. Looks like you know Branch. 
**Henry Mascot** *[09:13]*: No, no, I said you worked at Branch. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[09:16]*: Yes, I did. S. 
**Henry Mascot** *[09:20]*: You don't work around Smasher. Okay, cool. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[09:31]*: Okay, I think. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[10:03]*: Okay, so it's just about to run. Let me. Let me go back to this test now. 
**Henry Mascot** *[10:12]*: Okay. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[10:16]*: Okay, I think it works now. Okay, so I just want to test with tickets. Let me just go to one of the tickets we currently have in QA dev. So let me just refresh this. So what I did pretty much right now is more of just looking at the ui and I mean, this version actually just looks at the UI and validates from the acceptance criteria that has been provided. Sometimes if it doesn't find like an acceptance criteria, it might not actually provide something really nice, which is still something I'm trying to work on. So. Okay, I'm just going to try this now. So to see. I don't know if you can see my screen. 
**Henry Mascot** *[11:10]*: Yeah. Okay, so you give it. But I mean, obviously in production there will be a workflow that just goes through tickets by itself. Like, you're not going to have to be giving it tickets manually, right? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[11:24]*: Yes, of course. In fact, what this should normally do is because right now I'm just testing what this should normally do is like look at the. Look at the qa. The QA on Dev, you know, board. That's this particular part here. You should normally look at this board here and then just iterate over each ticket IDs. 
**Henry Mascot** *[11:51]*: Yeah. How does it know? How would he know what is front end work and what is like back end work? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[11:56]*: Okay, so I've actually done it such that from the description, it can infer if it's a front end, if it's a UI work or an API work. And in fact, I also even made it such that it could. It could also detect if there's an hybrid of both. Both front end and back end. 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:19]*: What do you. What model are you using? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[12:22]*: What is it? 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:23]*: What model are you using? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[12:25]*: Oh, I'm using OpenAI. Yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:27]*: Which one? Which model? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[12:29]*: GPT4.0. 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:31]*: It is in 4.0. Yeah, 4.0 is a bit old these days. You should be using Codex 5. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[12:39]*: Right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:39]*: Should be using 5 codecs oh, 5 codecs. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[12:43]*: Yeah. Maybe I could change. Change it to that. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[12:45]*: Like just try. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[12:46]*: Try. 
**Henry Mascot** *[12:46]*: I mean you obviously, I mean it breaks. The prompts are not the same. So if your prompt is for 4, it won't work for 5 codecs so you have to prompt it later. But I mean 5 codecs is the best at coding in the GPT lineup. And then I would also make it model a little bit model agnostic. We have a model switcher I'm not sure I said could use them and Fikara them should start using it. I'm not sure if Fikaya has started. I doubt. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[13:15]*: So the model switcher should automatically have. 
**Henry Mascot** *[13:18]*: One switch from allow us to switch whatever model. I mean we can write a logic but the whole infrastructure for. We built the internal tool. I mean I think we built it on an open source model switcher so that you can easily swap your models without breaking your products. Yeah. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[13:36]*: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, I can't even find any ticket on QL on dev anymore. But I'm just looking at picking a random one here. 
**Henry Mascot** *[13:47]*: Yes. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[13:48]*: So I'm just going to pick the one that is ready for staging right here. 
**Henry Mascot** *[13:53]*: Okay. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[13:54]*: Yeah, let me pick 601-76-1017. 
**Henry Mascot** *[14:01]*: So can you tell that's front end or your mod your code will tell you the model. The agent would automatically detect if it's front end or backend. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[14:10]*: Yes, the. Okay, this version does not detect that. But the one I'm currently developing, he's actually already detecting that already. In fact that was what I was testing while I jumped on this call. 
**Henry Mascot** *[14:24]*: Okay, but no, I like give it the 6017. Let's see what it does. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[14:28]*: Yeah. 6017 so 6017. 
**Henry Mascot** *[14:45]*: So we did run it. What's supposed to happen now? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[14:48]*: Yeah, so what happens right now is it fetches the JIRA issue first with using the ticket ID and then generates like steps via the LLM. So the LLM just generates like steps that it takes. I mean that should. That should take rather to do the validation and then it should then execute the UI validation as closely just it's a. And then afterwards summarize the result that is produced after that and then post that comment or feedback to jira. So because from the summarized result we can actually create some feedback using OpenAI still and then post that on Jira. 
**Henry Mascot** *[15:34]*: Okay. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[15:43]*: So this takes some time. Let me see what's going on. Okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[15:56]*: Okay, good. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[15:57]*: So now I have this output right here. But so I also had to like do some Formatting here because I, I noticed that JIRA has like this special way of writing comments. So it's not like the traditional markdown and stuff. So what I did was just to like format it in their own way. Yeah. So but I would like to just go down to the comments side of this ticket that I used. Yeah, just confirm how that looks. I don't know why it's not clicking. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[16:36]*: Okay. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[16:36]*: It's probably loading up. 
**Henry Mascot** *[16:39]*: JIRA is a monolithic database. They're going through their. Their issues. What PC did we give you? We give you a MacBook, right? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[16:57]*: No, I didn't call it easy. 
**Henry Mascot** *[16:59]*: We didn't give you a PC yet. Okay. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[17:03]*: Okay, so let's go down. I think this is new. I just need to check for the comment. Latest comment. Okay. Yeah, I guess this is it one minute ago. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[17:13]*: So this is it. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[17:14]*: Okay, so the automated result again, it says all tests passed as expected. Then test cases. So here it's. So each of this, each of these test cases we see here was generated from the acceptance. 
**Henry Mascot** *[17:34]*: It's now not writing what they are. It's just. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[17:37]*: Yes. Yeah, yeah. As the last time I checked, this actually wrote. Wrote down the details of each test. So. 
**Henry Mascot** *[17:45]*: Okay, is there an old one in any ticket that I can see or you delete them after that? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[17:50]*: Yes, yes, yes. 
**Henry Mascot** *[17:52]*: Let's see the old ones. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[17:54]*: Let me go back to the old ones. 
**Henry Mascot** *[17:56]*: This is pretty cool. But also these guys are. These guys have started to build some of these products. Oh, that's also has a bug bot. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[18:14]*: Oh, interesting. I think, Let me see this. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[18:21]*: I think I have something here. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[18:31]*: Okay, this one is not detailed though. So let me go over the next one. I think there are cases when it's. 
**Henry Mascot** *[18:39]*: Not going to just detail them. Yeah, well, I think you should enforce it. Right? I mean it can't just be abbreviating. You should tell you what exactly that is being passed. Right? This passes pass this past. Not even sure if these guys are using it, but I think Rovo on JIRA is supposed to be. So a bunch of people have it now. Codex is supposed to start doing it. Claude has theirs as well. So. But I mean if we do that, we don't have to pay to use theirs. Okay, this is yours. Let's go down. Okay. Right. All of them. The abbreviate. Abbreviate time. So just make that. Yeah, make that update. But yeah, but well done, man. I mean, later we can. 
**Henry Mascot** *[19:19]*: I think the demo with the rest of the team is on Monday, so Just fix some of these things so that you show. Well, you're doing with playwright. Does playwright record the steps or just. Is there any kind of like, debug inside? Playwrights. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[19:37]*: Yeah. So, okay, you mean when I say debugging, you mean, like, when it fails, you should log in. If you log. 
**Henry Mascot** *[19:44]*: Is there any log. Okay, I've done this. I've gone here. Does that display right? I mean, I know there's an API and it's code. Yeah. Do they. They don't provide any sort of like, video thing or anything like that? How do you. Tracy, no, for playwright. For you to see. Is it. It's like a log for. For some of the things it does. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[20:04]*: Yes. So another thing it does is screenshots. 
**Henry Mascot** *[20:08]*: Yes, that's what I meant. Yeah. Screenshots. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[20:11]*: Yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[20:12]*: Is your agent taking screenshots? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[20:14]*: Yeah, this. This actually does, which was why I would have loved to demo the recent version I'm trying to work on. 
**Henry Mascot** *[20:22]*: Demo that when it's ready on Monday. That's fine. I mean, this is not. This is just a regular. This is just a regular check in for. Okay, cool. What's. What's going on? Yeah, so, I mean, work on it. Let. Let's have it and let's see it on Monday then. Yeah. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[20:36]*: All right, boss. 
**Henry Mascot** *[20:37]*: All right, cool. Well done. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[20:40]*: Yeah, thank you. 
**Henry Mascot** *[20:44]*: How far. How are you doing on our HR agents? Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[21:08]*: Yeah, so I just want to, like, show what. Is. What I've done so far. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[21:18]*: Start. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[21:23]*: So can you see my screen? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[21:24]*: I don't know. 
**Henry Mascot** *[21:25]*: Yeah. Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[21:30]*: Okay. 
**Henry Mascot** *[21:31]*: Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[21:34]*: It's meant to, like, start showing all the things that I'm saying. Oh, yeah. So basically, I don't know, you can see. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[21:45]*: It'S. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[21:46]*: It's still not exact enough right now. 
**Henry Mascot** *[21:52]*: Oh, because you can join this our call. Interesting. Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[21:56]*: Like, it doesn't even need to join before. Like, you can just once you, like, click on the Chrome extension just. Or once you're like, on any Google Meet, it just pops out. 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:05]*: Right. Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[22:07]*: So I. I still think that, like, another thing that I'm still facing is my. My mic is still not really connecting with my mic, but I can hear you clearly. But I can see that, like, he can hear me. 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:29]*: Because it looks like you're translating like an idiot. Because it looks like you're trying to. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[22:37]*: Yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:37]*: Okay. But anyway, it is picking it, right? I mean. Yeah, there is definitely some. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[22:42]*: Yeah, I think one thing that he's trying to do is because I kind of like broke down the text into chunks. 
**Henry Mascot** *[22:49]*: Right. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[22:50]*: So Immediately like you finish speaking, it's not going to like admit like write them, transcribe everything down because the LLM plant processes and generate like suggestions like basically questions that you could ask it. 
**Henry Mascot** *[23:04]*: Yeah, yeah. So I mean, yeah, so there's some thinking around how does it put it together. That's a little bit of a complex problem because I mean if it keeps taking them one by one by one, is it able. It needs, because it needs to be able to, even though he's recording it one by one needs to be able to still chunk it into the whole context and reliable enough to be consistent. Because if it's I say three words, then it takes the three words and send in, then I say two words and then they don't all fit in as one sentence within the longer context, then its recommendation would still be a bit shit. 
**Henry Mascot** *[23:44]*: So maybe what to do might be to start step number one might be instead of being real time if you're struggling with, I mean if there's any way that you can keep chunking the words together and then, you know, keep consistency. If there isn't, maybe baby steps might be take it at the end of the call and recommend for the next call. So I mean there are two different problems. I mean value. So okay, let's, let's go back more problem I'll be trying to solve. We're trying to give a co pilot to a hiring team that helps them ask or help them interview or get the best value out of an interview. Right. For someone. And some of our key ideas are ahead of a call. 
**Henry Mascot** *[24:38]*: One of the things we do is we take all your, we take candidates, you know, a lot of the contacts, we take their previous, we take their CV, their LinkedIn, we take the forms they filled, all the tests they've done. We give it a try. GPT and ChatGPT has all that context and then you can ask it, okay, cool. Based on this person's thing, what are their skills, what are their weaknesses, where I did good, how did he fit into the JD we're trying to hire, whether the competencies, etc. And then what are the questions we should ask them in this interview? Then after that interview is done, we take the interview, we put it back in the transcript and then we say okay, cool. Based off that, you know what's up, right? 
**Henry Mascot** *[25:20]*: And then you updates the person's competitors, you give snapshot number one. He does snapshot number two after interview number one and she says, here's what to ask them. So, so essentially we do this with ChatGPT and so what we're now trying to do is build something that build an agent that replicates this thing that we're doing with Charge, but go a step further. I mean look, it comes on the call, listens to the call, automatically updates the candidates kind of like profile, you know, with all the information, match it to the JD and then prepare the questions for the next meeting. 
**Henry Mascot** *[25:54]*: And then maybe the next step after that is it's on the meeting, it has all the context of the candidate and it's in real time saying okay, this is discussing based on his cv, he only worked for two years, he's you know, he just lied. Oh no, no, that's wrong. Or ask him this because this, this. Right. So we're trying to now do real time as like a co pilot to do that. But if real time is a bit more technically challenging, we can take a step back and still go back to step. And you think okay, cool. And it comes on the call, it takes the transcript and then he puts it in with all the rest of the information and recalculates the person's profile. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[26:38]*: You know, like, you mean after this one's after the call, right? Yes, he does that on the like websites. 
**Henry Mascot** *[26:47]*: Maybe let's start there. Let's. Let me. Let's it on that and then maybe we can see. I would think through if there's any other way to solve this live problem. Obviously it's solvable because Fireflies. Fireflies has already solved. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[26:59]*: Yeah. And why I'm angry because Firefly doesn't have like an open solution. I've checked the Internet and the. 
**Henry Mascot** *[27:08]*: Fireflies guy is also Nigeria. Is the CTO is Nigeria. Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[27:11]*: I just feel that like they have really cracked engineers because yes, they did it before. 
**Henry Mascot** *[27:20]*: Nobody. The. The new one is. I mean the Fireflies thing. But no, this live transcript thing is pre. Is post LLM. So it's not. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[27:28]*: That was Pre LLM. 
**Henry Mascot** *[27:30]*: No, no, it's new. It's a newer feature too. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[27:33]*: I mean like Fireflies in itself, like being able to join calls and take a meeting. 
**Henry Mascot** *[27:38]*: It was pre. It was pre. It was very early. It was very early. I mean they're probably one of the very first people that it was very one. It was one of the very first people that started using it's possible GPT. Right. Because when did they launch? Let's say when Bitfire flies launch. Because it might be nearly a lot of the Few businesses that like where that launch with GPT3. Right. I mean there's one business I know very well copy AI. They were the very first ones along with GPT2, GPT3 before people even knew what GPT was. There was no charge GPT. Yeah, there's some. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[28:18]*: But they could have been using it in house when. Before OpenAI launched. 
**Henry Mascot** *[28:22]*: Yeah, but they know these guys have been at it much longer than that because open AI GPT3 was maybe like 2022. These guys launched in 2020, 2016. So they've been. They've been at it for a little bit. So that means they had their own model before LLMs. Interesting. Yeah. Anyways, let's do the. Let's see the web thing. Let's see what the web thing can do before we come back to this. Okay. The CEO of Fireflies response. I mean on. I mean we're connected on LinkedIn and you know, I engage his post and he comes back sometimes. So maybe let me even see if I can connect with Sam and ask him for if they can give us a tip on how they do it. I know they will tell us that we should use the. We should go and use Fireflies. 
**Henry Mascot** *[29:18]*: But can you not connect to Fireflies APIs? Do you need to like what if you connect the fireflies API you connect to now you take the meetings after the meetings. The. The API doesn't allow you to take meetings in real time. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[29:30]*: I don't think they. They have at. When I was building it, they didn't have that. Yeah, they didn't have that. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[29:43]*: Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[29:43]*: Just a minute. 
**Henry Mascot** *[29:59]*: Yeah, it would be a lot of work to stream it to. I mean to be able to stream it. Yeah. Wow. They do. Dude, hold on. I asked chatgpt again. Let me. Because this in a way it doesn't Let me not because he's using instant. Let me change it to the thinking model because the instant model might be a bit. Okay, so. So you have a lot of things in here. Right? I might even just be complicating what you're building. Let's go back. So because in your own thing you Assuming that the process. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we'll look at it after. Okay, so. So your, your building because the main. Go back to your meeting thing. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[31:03]*: Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[31:05]*: The point of viewer. 
**Henry Mascot** *[31:07]*: No, no, the. Okay, joining. Okay, it's joined. So what happens now? 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[31:15]*: Okay, right now it doesn't say anything. It just listens in on the conversation. Probably like Victor engaging with the. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[31:25]*: Victor. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[31:26]*: Engaging with the candidates rights. Then after the Whole like after you interview process, we end the meeting. The bots leaves the meeting also and it now starts to not process. It takes all the transcripts from, you know, the dialogue that both the candidate and following have been having so far and like it can now assess the candidates whether they should move into the next round or not. 
**Henry Mascot** *[31:55]*: Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[31:57]*: And they could also like playback on like the dashboard too. So that's something that like. 
**Henry Mascot** *[32:02]*: Okay, so. Let's see what will happen to that candidate. So just take it out. No, that's fireflies now. What are you doing? Yes sir. Okay, okay. Running bird. Ish. I mean it's fine but. Okay, cool. When if it was done it will. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[32:44]*: Not do it normally. Like okay, let me try to add it again because once it's just done it meant to like just don't show me like the video and all of that. 
**Henry Mascot** *[32:55]*: Okay. And now this is your series recalls API Abby. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[33:02]*: Yeah, yeah. So I'm just trying to you know, leave the meetings on here. Okay. Yes. I was meant to like leave the meeting from. From the dashboard. 
**Henry Mascot** *[33:41]*: Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[33:43]*: So it's going to like fetch. I think it's because of the meetings at the amount of time like the. What was in the meeting. So I mean it's kind of the numbers are. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And like you could also like check for recording and some stuff like that without. From the. I. 
**Henry Mascot** *[34:07]*: Okay, this is it. Okay. Because. Okay, look at it's coming. It's just loading slowly by. Wow, he does through video recording. That's so cool. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[34:22]*: Just do that basically. 
**Henry Mascot** *[34:23]*: But I guess it's. I mean over time it will figure it out because. But it's processing the transcript I reckon on the side as well. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[34:31]*: Yes. 
**Henry Mascot** *[34:31]*: Boom. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[34:32]*: I mean like we just took it like seconds. We put it like just seconds in. Right. So yeah, it didn't really like process a lot. 
**Henry Mascot** *[34:40]*: Yeah. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[34:40]*: So yeah, that was something that like I just put in place of the Chrome extension in case like become attention is faulty one way or another. I think you have something to fall back on. 
**Henry Mascot** *[34:52]*: Yeah. Okay. So. So I think. Yeah, so I think you should. So let's work. So here you add it and then it's supposed to look at it and then based on. So you upload the person's cv. So yeah. So if we do it again. So you should put the. So you upload the person's cv. You should have. You should. So let me. You take the meeting notes. Right. And you take a meeting notes from today and you give it to Chad a little bit of your plan. So let's focus on the real time one might be a little bit too ambitious, you know, again, because you don't have a lot of time anymore. So let's get to something that is valuable that people can use. So what is valuable that people can use? 
**Henry Mascot** *[35:42]*: Let's start with something that tries to replicate what we already do with ChatGPT and save people time of downloading CVs and pasting it and all that. Right. So how would I think about it? The way I would think about it is we want to hire a role, then we do a jd. So the first impute is the jd. Right. In addition to the jd, let's say we do a scorecard. I mean, we're not there yet, but ideally we should do a scorecard. Here are all the things that we want in this person. You know, JD is the public facing scorecard. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[36:16]*: Yeah, we have that like this job position. 
**Henry Mascot** *[36:19]*: Yeah. Okay, awesome. So you open that. Fantastic. So you put the jd. So. Yeah. So let's assume the impute. The first impute is internal documents around the job, scorecards, job descriptions. Then there's the overall. So this is parole. But then there's the overall thing we always look at as a company. So let's assume that there is the criteria we want to measure the candidate by. There is our values and our competencies. So our competencies and our values. You know, so this, that's level number one. That applies to every single candidate. Okay. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[36:55]*: On the like scorecard. 
**Henry Mascot** *[36:57]*: Right. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[36:58]*: Like I was looking about that, but I just kind of skipped my mind. 
**Henry Mascot** *[37:01]*: Yeah. So let me open the document and show you and work you and let's just draw it out a little bit. Let me share. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[37:09]*: All right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[37:10]*: I think this is where Miro is. Miro would be. Would have been very good. But let's play around a little bit. So, so let's assume that, I mean the goal. What goal are we trying to achieve? AI, you know, AI or data driven, kind of like decision making. Right. So what are we trying to do? We're simply trying to look at the data we have. Right. To use the data we have to decide data, we have to decide. We process it. Process to decide an output. Right. Process. And then we come out with. Okay, and a decision. Right. And that's specifically. And then within the, within this data we have, let's call it data. Then within this data, let's say if you break it Down. I will refine this data. 
**Henry Mascot** *[38:15]*: But if we break this down, if you break this down on the data side we have criteria. Judging criteria. Judging criteria. Right. So within this data there is internal and then there is external, which is the candidate. Right. And then within this, within internal. Within the internal, this is. I'm looking at data. Okay, so within internal there is judging criteria. Within this judging criteria, we're talking about values and competencies. Okay, okay, Values and competencies. I mean I'll think of more things. And then there is current role. Within the current role we will have things like job description and we have any scorecards. Right. I mean I believe what then I guess like we can maybe compare with. Yeah, I mean you can also see an existing scene profiles. There are a bunch of things you need to look at. 
**Henry Mascot** *[40:43]*: We consider, right, we consider ocean personality profiles, templates, let me call it that. So, and so this is our internal judging criteria. And then that internal judging criteria. This is internal. And let's assume that there is an external bit. There is not. Let's assume there is obviously the external bits. I mean this would probably be a bit more technical, but I will work it out later. So let's assume external and then in external we're now looking at every single thing about the candidate. Right? We're looking at your CV plus LinkedIn and in all the information we collect and then we try to collect quite a bit of information these days, we collect your ocean, we collect your. I mean on the personality front, let's assume we can break this down into personality. We collect two ocean and we collect MBTI ocean. 
**Henry Mascot** *[42:15]*: Okay, let's assume this is candidates history, job history, profile. So whatever allows us to capture this can be cv. This can be any other thing. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[42:43]*: That. 
**Henry Mascot** *[42:43]*: We should be able to consider important. And it's if there's more can decide. But base right now I think it's mostly cv. I will open a charge piece thing and look at real quick. Let me share my whole window. Let's see real quick what we can collect. So okay, these guys are logged out of this account. They don't use this account anymore. I believe they have moved to a different account. But before I go to that. So for this crime profile, what do they collect? So they collect LinkedIn, then they collect all the stages of interview. Then they collect the competency framework, commercial department competency and local clarification. What is this document? Okay, so there is the job competency. So there is currently. There is currently there is no competency. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[44:26]*: Row. 
**Henry Mascot** *[44:35]*: Competency clarification okay. Is there anything else we collect? Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. Right. And then that's that. I mean we can also look at what to add. Okay, cool. So we collect a cv, we collect that. And then there is now the interactions. Right. So this is the external internal. And then we can kind of like go to the. I think I can use it in here. Internal, external judging criteria. Reduce all of this to smaller text. Okay. Okay. External internal. That's data. Okay. I mean this is fine. This is data. So we can now go to process. And then on the process side what we're now looking at is let me see the interviews. Right. Interviews. I don't know, maybe some people might have. Depending on the role interviews are the main thing. 
**Henry Mascot** *[46:18]*: So we do first stage that gets ingested which we call HR screen or people chats the screen. Right. So that's the first stage. And then we do second stage. Again this depends. So here it kind of like now changes a little bit depending on what role we're hiring. If you're engineering, you take a contest faster. A contest, you do a home assessment. So I think it's either we set it up. I think for most teams it's the same but different rules change. So it's either we do one simple flow that can be generic or allow configuration based different stages. But that's the first stage that we screen. But anyway, so I guess if I don't complicate it, let's just say all the interview. How many amount of interview you don't get suggested. So interviews, interview, meeting transcripts. 
**Henry Mascot** *[47:29]*: So let me simplify it so that it doesn't get too complex. So could be one to X. Right. How many other interviews get suggested? But I guess the point is all that gets ingested, what else do we check? So all that gets ingested. So I think I might be able to put the spotlight so that I don't. Okay, so that's the process. So all this is the data that gets ingested. Right. And then as this get data is all getting ingested, they're now setting things we want to. So based on this we're not building a profile for the candidate. Right. So we're doing a profile for this candidate. I actually need to brainstorm a little bit on bit to see what like what's obtainable. So we want to say maybe before you know when the role is hired. 
**Henry Mascot** *[48:44]*: So immediately we go into your thing, we create the rule, we upload this boom that said, okay, cool. That's where it is. Immediately someone applies. Either we hook it up for that data to get fed in via some sort of a webhook, or we upload the information manually. But either ways you set up the beginning of the first setup for the company is your Pluto competencies. You upload all the kind of like personality templates and then on the team level, you upload all the team competencies. You can use a spreadsheet really. And then you assume the model should be able to process that and hold that in some sort of rag memory. And then when you create a role, every single role you're trying to hire. So okay, cool, we're hiring an AI ML role already. The agents already has the companies. 
**Henry Mascot** *[49:45]*: I mean you can't be one agent, right? Because you can't hold on infinite memory. So it would be Okiko, an agent that pulls selectively pulls data selectively from which memory. So there's a company information, the values etc, the things that are important to watch out for every single person we hire. And then for that particular AI ML role, we want to put in a jd, the JD again and follows our format so that you should be able to ingest that, combine it and have a profile of who should look like that and upload the scorecast. The specific things that we need to even maybe. I think we put this on the jd but like, let's assume. Okay, cool. Objective, like role objective. You know, let's assume six to 12 months. I'll make people do this. Right? So why are we hiring this person? 
**Henry Mascot** *[50:34]*: What are they coming to do? What, what are they coming to fulfill? Right. And so yeah, so if that all that is set up, then we'll assume, okay, we have enough data so when someone applies, they fill the form. Cool. I'm in our process. You fill the form. Let me call this. Okay, actually let me put it on here. You fill the form, the interest form. The interest form has a bunch of questions we ask every single candidate. Again, all that data gets funneled into a Google form for every single row. So you can probably put that using a Google service integration. But yeah, we got, we ask an interest form that you're filling, setting things, how much you want, setting competencies as well. That is indicated on the form. 
**Henry Mascot** *[51:32]*: Would you know how to use this to tell us where you want to be in five years? All those things. What else do we do? 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[51:41]*: Good question. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[51:42]*: So like that form that you feel the element like, I mean fetch the. 
**Henry Mascot** *[51:49]*: Information, you should be able to fetch it correct. So, so I mean obviously. So everything I'm saying here will go in. You know, there are interview. They're probably already existing interview questions. There's also a rubric. This is, let me call this hiring rubric. Right? So hiring rubric. I mean again, maybe we'll work through this later. But I mean if I show you what a hiring rubric looks like for every single role we're hiring, for instance, we're hiring an AI executive ops that their job is really a ton of AI work or AI management, for instance, this is a rubric for this rule. There are some general questions that we want to ask, I want to get answers to. And these are probably different from interview questions, but they can also be interview questions. Everybody gets greeted. Cool. This Alice gets created. What attracted you? 
**Henry Mascot** *[52:50]*: Okay, here's how I think they are answered here. Blah, blah. So this is an example of a rubric, right? So it's just one of the, one of the tools, right? So that's, There are multiple artifacts that we use. So okay, cool. Interest form then interview. Interview transcripts. Interview transcripts, right? And then at every single stage. So now if I call this, you know, then I mean this is not, this is still, this is process. But I mean this is still data. Let me go to process now. At every single stage of the process, we want certain things to happen. So let me now call this process then. So let me now call this, you know, this. So this is internal, external. So both, I mean like we're now in the process. Interview. Let me just call it interview Shah or hiring process. Hiring data. 
**Henry Mascot** *[54:04]*: Okay, now in process. What I want to be able to do with this process is to be able to say at every single stage, here is what the LLM should be externalizing. So prehire, right? When you, when pre hire, let's assume, you know, you've updated, you've uploaded the, you've updated these first parts. There should be a state. The pre, you know, call it process. And then let me call this estate within this pre hiring states. When we've uploaded pre hiring state should be okay, cool, we have uploaded these things. What does it look like? What does that. I guess there's a view that just says, okay, here's the role you're hiring. LLM will try to look at someone who's like this, like this. There should be some sort of empty state with some data. 
**Henry Mascot** *[55:16]*: And then from that state, when you upload, as you put in more information, it changes, right? You know Kind of like the states will have some like versions, you know, if let's assume when we're setting up the product in the first place, all our values are in there, the personality types, you know, let's assume 360 reports of teammates, etc, all those things are there just to give us a sense of oh, you know, here's the kind of like, you know, just have it in context. Right. So now let's say we are not going to hire a. Want to hire a head of sales. He knows what our values are. He knows kind of like good personalities. He has to like maybe existing past profiles of some of our teams. 
**Henry Mascot** *[55:55]*: And so for a head of sales, really upload this, we can keep it simple where we're not changing a lot of things in the ui, but maybe it has it in memory. Maybe only upload all these things. Maybe you can ask a question. So maybe there are some simple things that we generate and you don't have to think about all these things yourself. I'm just giving you a full picture. I would probably spend some time with the designers that can come up with ideas of how these things would look like. But I'm just giving you a full picture of the whole process of how this thing should become. I mean you will get somewhere, but I will obviously keep building this out later so we see whatever we get. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[56:31]*: Right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[56:34]*: So there's the prehistate. As you're loading in more information, more things will have, will be happening and then at every single point of the less assume interest. Right. So prehistorize when you upload everything. Interest indication. Interest indication, which is. And what are we using? What are we doing with interest indication. Right. This is where the company has indicated again first that people have selected them and people are saying, okay, cool, we think you should move forward or not. We need to decide. One decision that we will need to make would be who gets, at what stage do people get funneled into this? Right. So this is a decision that we need to make because we might decide, oh, we want to make every single person that applies that their information goes through this system. 
**Henry Mascot** *[57:35]*: Or you can also decide it's only for people who have gotten to a certain stage. Maybe HR has screened them and HR thinks they should advance and then we can decide. You know, I'll just show you real quick so you have a sense of what I'm talking about. So, so yeah, so I mean our stages are very kind of like we have so many stages but you know, let's assume how it starts is that People, you know, the HRV puts people in a profile that he thinks that they could maybe they make it and you know, whoever the manager is goes to the profile and say, oh no, we're not going to hire this person. We're going to. I don't think this person is good enough to enter a process. No, no. 
**Henry Mascot** *[58:19]*: Then HR will chat with them and then we'll collect all this information and then start running them through the process. So we need to, if we've talked about, okay, could this will get funneled in. This will get funneled in. And then at what stage do we now need to start using kind of like the HR agents or the recruitment agent that you're working on? It could be, oh, immediately someone gets the first stage, we've spoken to them, then we activate it. That means everybody that we've done their profile in here does not get processed. It only gets processed after we've had one chat with them. So that's also. That's what I'm talking about. So yeah, so let's assume at what stage it could be most likely. Most likely. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[59:06]*: After. 
**Henry Mascot** *[59:10]*: Most likely. HR screen. Let's assume. Okay. HR screen. So they indicate interest. We upload all the information. So if it's HR screen, that means this is uploaded retrospectively because HR screen is stage one. Stage which one? Right, so indicate interest here means you know, you fill the form. This is. You fill the interest form. That's, that's stage one. So if you fill the interest form and then I guess yeah, prehire same should interest form. Then we have to decide where we will pull it. So many we need to decide this one now. So we'll put their proof LinkedIn profile then JD so this is the information that comes in or either of these three. Also sometimes we have these two and then we send them the form before we chat. Sometimes we send them the form but anyways one way or the other. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:00:36]*: And then for stage one and also depending on who we're talking about, sometimes for engineering this starts with a canned and iotest which again this is just a PDF that gets faded. I'm not sure can has APIs, PDF or API but yeah, but most likely PDF that means someone has to upload it or something engineering. And then stage number one is then this is just a transcript, interview transcripts. And then I guess interviewer notes this rubric which is where we cannot reach them. So all that goes in and I guess as a result of all this going in, something needs to come out right. So Prehire, you know we get. Okay cool. This is the profile we need after the person. So I guess we need decide. Let's see what's right now we get from chat GPT. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:02:09]*: So I mean so again this is part of the problem we're trying to solve. So because this guy is running this a long time after, right. So this guy is running this at the end of the process. So but the idea is supposed to be as the process is proceeding now, the agent is helping in the decision making. So because the agent has all this information after this is sent in, there should be a state which is maybe some sort of rate candidates which you already have right now. So you read them on something maybe rate them on. Rate them maybe multiple rating views based on JD based on whatever rubric. Right. There'll be some rating. So so immediately someone and then some comments. So insights. Right. Again don't, don't be, don't think about this as oh, you know plenty. Right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:03:22]*: Again this is a vision of a document, right. You don't have to do all of them yourself. The system will keep improving it after you. So cool. So after this stage what happens is we read the candidate and then after stage one the profile also gets updated, right. Some extra things get added, maybe things like updates. I would like to version this so I wouldn't want it to replace this. So I'd like to have maybe screen rating interest, blah blah. You can chat with. There'll be a chart. So if you think about it as you have the profile this would, if I can like think about this, the way I would look at the designers to design this, it would probably be, you know, you probably have the candidates profile, you know, with you know. Right. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:04:24]*: And then for this role let's assume that there will be multiple because of the multiple states. Prehire. So it would be Priyan. Prehire should be on the. Let's assume maybe the view before this would be CEO of Curacao. Right. That's what I can hire. And then the pre hire would kind of like just have information right. By the time you upload the JD and the rubric. And this would just have a ton of information. We can decide what it is on. Blah blah. This is what we need. Okay. This is what the rule is looking for. Blah blah, blah blah blah. Right. So that's a snapshot of the rule itself. You know, the competencies, what the person needs to look like. And now as people start applying, you know, now that gets into that state, right. So interest indication. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:05:19]*: So this starts with interest indication. So if I call this tabs or whatever views there will be stage one. So this will be all be different tabs. You know, if you click on this tab or click on the View, it will now show. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[01:05:37]*: Yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:05:38]*: AI is recommendation, etc. Based on, you know, based on the CV. What am I doing? I'm putting it, okay, CV based on, you know, recommendations to look at stage one. The recommend. And the reason I want the states is I want to be able to see the progression, right. Because maybe when we talk to them first time, you know, we judge them, oh, this person is a weak candidate. We talk to them as stage two. Those two information add up together and then, you know, you feel like, okay, this person is doing well. But if you go back, you can see, oh, at this point we didn't think this was interesting, but after we learned this in stage one, we now think it's interesting. So I want to preserve the states. Yeah. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:06:22]*: And then from there you can go to, you know, stage two and stage three. Right. And then finally, like, kind of like the, you know, like a decision screen, right. That analysis. And then there'll be a bunch of other things, right. Like let's assume that there will be. Right. There's a view that there is the competency based on. On team, you know, or do we say at every single stage you should give us this. No, I think it should happen. It should happen at the. At the end. Happen at the end. So interest. So interest. Yeah. 
**Emmanuel Ayodele** *[01:07:13]*: So what would. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:07:14]*: What should happen at every single stage would be. It would. It would. At the indication, interest. The agent analyzes this information and gives this output, rates the candidate based on the JD and the rubric. And after we've had a first interview and then the notes going, then he also updates snapshot two. So this is so again, same thing. It gives us rates, gives us insights. And then maybe, right, I guess depending on the candidate. So you erase the candidate again based on the JD and the rubric insights. And it starts to now say things like, or maybe it will be in all of them. Really, it will be in all of them. So maybe this is not. This is a general thing. This snapshot just gets updated at every single stage. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:08:14]*: But it will remain the same thing, which is okay, strengths, weaknesses, friends, weaknesses. Email interview questions. You know, what interview questions we want to ask them. What things do we want to validate? Right. Must validate, you know, interview questions. I mean, the reason, again, I'm seeing All these things on the call. Because I mean by the time you take the. We take this Fireflies transcript and dump it on GPT like thinking or pro, it will be able to break these things very well. And then you say, okay, you have like two, three weeks. What should you try to achieve in two, three weeks? And then the rest of it can go on a roadmap for somebody else to keep improving from there. So yeah, but at every single stage, this information gets updated. I mean I can divide this so that. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:09:29]*: Divide this so that it feels like it's a different things so that all of them are. It doesn't mean that all these applies at every single stage. So every single stage this information gets generated. Every single stage, this information gets generated. Every single stage this information gets generated. Right. So you do stage two, you know, it tells us okay, here's interviews, interview questions for next stage. You know, higher, don't hire higher. Entire recommendation. Then we probably have like full pages. Stage one, Stage two, Stage three. Then we wanted to see. We check their competencies, tell the signals things to have a cool funny thing hide on high also exists culture. Then we have the password. We're looking at culture. But I guess this culture. Should we have that in every single stage? 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:10:57]*: So maybe we can have this as just interview interview stages instead of having it one by one. And then within interview stages after every single interview will just be like. Just be like a interview one with the recommendations that is for anything we need. And then you know, interview two. Okay. Interview three. Right. Based on the transcript and then on all. And then we now have maybe a few other things that are important based on what we need to look at on the profile. So cursor. We're looking at our values and potential. Right. Values and competencies. What else is there? Values competencies. Should I call this values competencies summary after every re. Interview with like a general. By the way, I hope I don't have another meeting. Okay, I do need to go now to hiring. But. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:13:32]*: But I think I. I've given you some. Again, if you take the meeting note and dump in. Yeah. It'd be very helpful in kind of helping you scoop it out. 
**Oluwafikayomi Adeleke** *[01:13:42]*: Just also helping like restructure. 
**Henry Mascot** *[01:13:45]*: Yeah. So yeah. So you think about it like that. Finally real competency. What else do we ask? This is the time we want to make decisions. I'll go through these things and I'll. I will scope out the document. Well, recruiter agents. Yeah. So yeah. So just start doing this and then we can see where it goes. But, yeah, but at every single stage, as we put in more information, it's that, okay, could we up that information or do we just pull it from somewhere? You know, it's not impossible that it integrates with Fireflies. I mean, the HR uses a. They use a very specific. I guess if they name the meeting somehow we can automatically put the meeting notes via API and assign else if that's also how someone just downloads and uploads.
