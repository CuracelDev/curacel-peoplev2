## Screenshots
Screenshots referenced in conversations are located at:
```
/Users/henrymascot/Pictures/Screenshots/
```

When I reference screenshots, I may use:
- A specific path like `Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot 2025-12-30 at 1.30.40 AM.png`
- Relative references like "latest screenshot", "last 3 screenshots", "most recent screenshot"

For relative references, list the files in the Screenshots folder sorted by modification time and read the appropriate ones. For example:
- "latest screenshot" = most recently modified file
- "last 3 screenshots" = 3 most recently modified files
